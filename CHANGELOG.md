# Changelog

Newest first. Each heading is `## <version> — <title>`; each fix commit adds one entry under
`## Unreleased`, written for the person using the editor.

## Unreleased

- The Windows app opens a markdown file chosen with File > Open (Ctrl+O), named on the command
  line, or dropped on the window, and saves it with File > Save (Ctrl+S) or Save As
  (Ctrl+Shift+S). Saving writes only the characters you changed and keeps the file's line endings
  and byte order mark. A dot before the file name in the title bar shows unsaved changes; opening
  another file or closing the window asks whether to save them first. A file that is not UTF-8 is
  not opened, so it cannot be changed by saving.
- Syntax the editor does not display as formatted text — raw HTML, front matter, footnotes, math,
  GitHub alerts and link definitions — shows as a labelled box or chip holding its markdown
  source. You cannot type inside it, and it saves exactly as it was. A link or footnote definition
  that text still refers to cannot be deleted; delete the text that refers to it first.
- Markdown is shown as formatted text you can type into. Typing changes only the characters you
  typed in the file, line breaks inside a paragraph stay where they were, and Undo puts back the
  original bytes. When the file changes outside the editor, only the blocks that changed are
  replaced and the cursor stays where it was.
